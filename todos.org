* TODOs

** Visuals

*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', ensure that extension window 
 size does not change (ie. make a fixed window size that can accomdate
 the buttons and text)
*** DONE Implement initial screen that gives the user the choice of how
 many email threads they want to review and label
*** DONE Implement review screen that displays one email thread at a time
 with buttons that enable the user to navigate to the next email thread
*** TODO Make the 'next' button turn into a 'finish' button when the user
 has reviewed up to the max review count for a given review session
*** TODO Implement finished screen that tells the user how many emails
 they reviewed and gives them the option to start a new review session
*** TODO enable the user to skip already reviewed emails
*** TODO auto apply the reviewed label once an email is viewed
*** TODO apply auto-fade after 5 seconds to the notification messages such as 'label already applied' etc.
*** TODO count number of returned threads, use MIN of user selected maxReviewCount and numOfReturnedThreads as the new maxReviewCount
*** TODO apply labels at the end of the review session

** Critical Functionality

*** DONE Add label to currently displayed email thread
*** DONE Display email counter for number of email threads processed
*** DONE Display first email thread on "review start"
*** DONE Remember in context/storage the current email thread being
 looked at so that if the extension is closed and reopened, 
 the same email as before is still being displayed
**** DONE Look into localstorage versus the current recommended alternative 
 to localstorage, list pros/cons
*** DONE Consistently display the body text of the email thread in the extension 
 window including emails that are written in HTML as well as plain text
*** DONE Add a 'next' button that will display the next email thread in the list
*** DONE Add a 'reset'/'quit' button that reinitializes extension to its initial state
*** TODO Cap a review session to the max reviews count
*** TODO Add two more buttons to the review screen that say 'yes' and 'no' to
 answer a question about the email thread being displayed
*** TODO Display the initial question for tree swipe on the review screen 
 for each email thread

** Development/Publishing Necessities

*** TODO Have the 'next' button not call any APIs and instead only display the next email thread in the list

** Bugs

*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', the extension window size changes (don't want this behavior)
*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', sometimes threads appear to be skipped (this is not what I want to happen)
*** DONE When attempting to display html emails, they are not yet able to be displayed in the extension (but I want to display plain text versions of the body text)
*** DONE Some subjects are not yet correctly parsed and displayed (see email from Interfusion)
*** FIX Japanese emails are not rendered correctly yet
*** FIX Currently the extension requests a new auth token every time an action is taken. Instead,
    the extension should request a new auth token only when the current token expires. This can
    be done w/ a refresh token or by checking the expiration time of the current token.
    Google typically returns a token expiration time in the response to the token request.
    A day before the token is to expire, we can request a new token and update the current token.
    This would be a critical fix for the extension to pass the review process.

** Enhancements

*** TODO tooltip/on-hover display of more info regarding what each label means as it pertains to each question, e.g. "reference means that the item in question is something you might want to refer back to later, but isn't itself an actionable item" (title attribute)
*** TODO Enhance body text display to be AI NLP summarized
*** TODO Use thread snippet to display body preview text in extension window IF body text is not available
*** TODO implement "rm labels" convenience function that removes all of the labels associated with treeswipe for a given number of email threads (by default 10)

** Stretch Goals

*** TODO enable the user to input their own decision trees
*** TODO enable hotkeys for answer questions
*** TODO enable back button to go to the previous email thread
