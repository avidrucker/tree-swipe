* TODOs

** Visuals

*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', ensure that extension window 
 size does not change (ie. make a fixed window size that can accomdate
 the buttons and text)
*** TODO Implement initial screen that gives the user the choice of how
 many email threads they want to review and label
*** TODO Implement review screen that displays one email thread at a time
 with buttons that enable the user to navigate to the next email thread

** Functionality

*** DONE Add label to currently displayed email thread
*** DONE Display email counter for number of email threads processed
*** TODO Display first email thread on "review start"
*** TODO Remember in context/storage the current email thread being
 looked at so that if the extension is closed and reopened, 
 the same email as before is still being displayed
**** DONE Look into localstorage versus the current recommended alternative to localstorage, list pros/cons
*** DONE Consistently display the body text of the email thread in the extension window
 including emails that are written in HTML as well as plain text
*** DONE Add a 'next' button that will display the next email thread in the list

** Bugs

*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', the extension window size changes (don't want this behavior)
*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', sometimes threads appear to be skipped (this is not what I want to happen)
*** DONE When attempting to display html emails, they are not yet able to be displayed in the extension (but I want to display plain text versions of the body text)
*** DONE Some subjects are not yet correctly parsed and displayed (see email from Interfusion)
*** FIX Japanese emails are not rendered correctly yet
*** FIX Currently the extension requests a new auth token every time an action is taken. Instead,
    the extension should request a new auth token only when the current token expires. This can
    be done w/ a refresh token or by checking the expiration time of the current token.
    Google typically returns a token expiration time in the response to the token request.
    A day before the token is to expire, we can request a new token and update the current token.
    This would be a critical fix for the extension to pass the review process.

** Enhancements

*** TODO Enhance body text display to be AI NLP summarized
*** TODO Have the 'next' button not call any APIs and instead only display the next email thread in the list
*** TODO Add a 'reset' button that reinitializes extension to its initial state
*** TODO Use thread snippet to display body preview text in extension window IF body text is not available
