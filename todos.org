* TODOs

** Visuals/UX Improvements

*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', ensure that extension window 
 size does not change (ie. make a fixed window size that can accomdate
 the buttons and text)
*** DONE Implement initial screen that gives the user the choice of how
 many email threads they want to review and label
*** DONE Implement review screen that displays one email thread at a time
 with buttons that enable the user to navigate to the next email thread
*** DONE Make the 'next' button turn into a 'finish' button when the user
 has reviewed up to the max review count for a given review session
*** TODO Implement finished screen that tells the user how many emails
 they reviewed and gives them the option to start a new review session
*** TODO apply auto-fade after 5 seconds to the notification messages such as 'label already applied' etc.
*** TODO Move buttons and question to the bottom of the screen
*** TODO Add a hover on which the subject text expands to show the full subject
 (not a tooltip, but the actual text itself)

** Core/Critical Functionality

*** TODO Pass reviewedCount back to the setup screen upon review completion to display
 the number of emails reviewed in the last review session
*** DONE Implement a 'skip' button that moves to the next email w/o applying any labels
*** TODO Implement pagination for email message retrieval so that, if there are
 less than the maxReviewCount threads returned, more threads can be retrieved
 and the user can successfully review the maxReviewCount threads (or less if
 there are no more unreviewed threads left, i.e. end of inbox reached), see
 https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/list
 (specifically pay attend to the 'pageToken' parameter and 'resultSizeEstimate')
*** DONE Add label to currently displayed email thread
*** DONE Display email counter for number of email threads processed
*** DONE Display first email thread on "review start"
*** DONE Remember in context/storage the current email thread being
 looked at so that if the extension is closed and reopened, 
 the same email as before is still being displayed
**** DONE Look into localstorage versus the current recommended alternative 
 to localstorage, list pros/cons
*** DONE Consistently display the body text of the email thread in the extension 
 window including emails that are written in HTML as well as plain text
*** DONE Add a 'next' button that will display the next email thread in the list
*** DONE Add a 'reset'/'quit' button that reinitializes extension to its initial state
*** DONE Cap a review session to the max reviews count
*** DONE Store for each email thread reviewed a list of labels that will be applied
 to the email thread once the review session is over (i.e when the user clicks 
 'finish' or 'quit')
*** DONE apply labels at the end of the review session
*** DONE enable the user to skip already reviewed emails
*** TODO Add notification to setup screen that tells the user how many
 emails they successfully reviewed in the last review session (non-persistent)
*** DONE auto apply the reviewed label once an email is viewed
*** TODO Implement a 'Finish and Save Early' button that will end the review session
 and apply the labels to the email threads that were reviewed up to that point
*** DONE Implement the user ability to be able to conditionally skip reviewing
 of emails that already have the 'Reviewed' label applied
*** DONE Add two more buttons to the review screen that say 'yes' and 'no' to
 answer a question about the email thread being displayed
*** DONE Display the initial question for tree swipe on the review screen 
 for each email thread
*** DONE Implement the ability to go down the decision tree for each email thread
*** DONE Implement a 'Quit w/o Saving' button that will end the review session
 and not apply any labels to the email threads that were reviewed
*** TODO count number of returned threads, use MIN of user selected maxReviewCount 
 and numOfReturnedThreads as the new maxReviewCount

** Development/Publishing Necessities

*** DONE Have the 'next' button not call any APIs and instead only display the next email thread in the list

** Bugs

*** DONE When refreshing the extension, sometimes the toggle gets reset (but it shouldn't)
*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', the extension window size changes (don't want this behavior)
*** DONE When clicking on 'next email', sometimes threads appear to be skipped (this is not what I want to happen)
*** DONE When attempting to display html emails, they are not yet able to be displayed in the extension (but I want to display plain text versions of the body text)
*** DONE Some subjects are not yet correctly parsed and displayed (see email from Interfusion)
*** DONE When answering questions, no/yes buttons are shown at leaf nodes (where they should not be no/yes buttons)
*** TODO Japanese emails are not rendered correctly yet
*** TODO Currently the extension requests a new auth token every time an action is taken. Instead,
    the extension should request a new auth token only when the current token expires. This can
    be done w/ a refresh token or by checking the expiration time of the current token.
    Google typically returns a token expiration time in the response to the token request.
    A day before the token is to expire, we can request a new token and update the current token.
    This would be a critical fix for the extension to pass the review process.

** Enhancements

*** DONE Use thread snippet to display body preview text
*** DONE implement "rm labels" convenience function that removes all of the labels 
 associated with treeswipe for a given number of email threads (by default 10)
*** DONE Move clear button to setup screen
*** DONE Implement the removal of all labels associated with the extension via the clear button
*** TODO Save the state of the current question in the state object so that if the user 
 closes the extension and reopens it, the same question is displayed
*** TODO check on extension load that all the necessary labels are present, and if not, 
 create them, then save the fact that labels have been created in global state object
*** TODO Implement a custom 'toast' notification system that will display messages 
 to the user in the extension window
*** TODO remove logic that checks to see if labels exist before applying them and 
 conditionally creates new labels, because we have already ensured that all the labels 
 exist when the extension loads
*** TODO Implement a 'Back' button that will allow the user to go back to the 
 previous email thread in the list
*** TODO switch over to https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.messages/batchModify 
 API to apply labels to multiple emails at once, and instead use labels as the keys, 
 and the email IDs as the values in the idsAndTheirPendinglabels
*** TODO tooltip/on-hover display of more info regarding what each label means as it 
 pertains to each question, e.g. "reference means that the item in question is something 
 you might want to refer back to later, but isn't itself an actionable item" (title attribute)
*** TODO Enhance body text display to be AI NLP summarized
*** TODO Next/Back 'carousel' buttons to navigate through email threads on the review screen
 where the left and right margins themselves are tall vertical clickable areas that, on hover,
 display the right and left chevrons respectively

** Stretch Goals

*** TODO enable the user to input their own decision trees
*** TODO enable hotkeys for answer questions
